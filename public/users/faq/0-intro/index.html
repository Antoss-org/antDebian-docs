<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This document answers questions frequently asked about Debian GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Definitions and overview</p>
<p>1.1. What is this FAQ?
1.2. What is Debian GNU/Linux?
1.3. OK, now I know what Debian is&hellip; what is Linux?!
1.4. Does Debian just do GNU/Linux?
1.5. What is the difference between Debian GNU/Linux and other Linux distributions? Why should I choose Debian over some other distribution?
1.6. How does the Debian project fit in or compare with the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s GNU project?
1.7. How does one pronounce Debian and what does this word mean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting and installing Debian GNU/Linux</p>
<p>2.1. What is the latest version of Debian?
2.2. Are there package upgrades in &ldquo;stable&rdquo;?
2.3. Where/how can I get the Debian installation images?
2.4. How do I install Debian from CD-ROMs?
2.5. Why does the official stable released CD-ROM contain symlinks for &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; and &ldquo;unstable&rdquo;? I thought this CD contains just &ldquo;stable&rdquo;!
2.6. Can I get and install Debian directly from a remote Internet site?
2.7. Are there any alternative strategies for booting the system installer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choosing a Debian distribution</p>
<p>3.1. Which Debian distribution (stable/testing/unstable) is better for me?</p>
<pre><code> 3.1.1. You asked me to install stable, but in stable so and so hardware is not detected/working. What should I do?
 3.1.2. Will there be different versions of packages in different distributions?
 3.1.3. The stable distributions really contains outdated packages. Just look at Kde, Gnome, Xorg or even the kernel. They are very old. Why is it so?
 3.1.4. If I were to decide to change to another distribution, can I do that?
 3.1.5. Could you tell me whether to install stable, testing or unstable?
 3.1.6. You are talking about testing being broken. What do you mean by that?
 3.1.7. Why is it that testing could be broken for months? Won't the fixes introduced in unstable flow directly down into testing?
 3.1.8. From an administrator's point of view, which distribution requires more attention?
 3.1.9. What happens when a new release is made?
 3.1.10. I have a working Desktop/cluster with Debian installed. How do I know which distribution I am running?
 3.1.11. I am currently using the stable version. Can I change to testing or unstable? If so, how?
 3.1.12. I am currently tracking testing (trixie). What will happen when a release is made? Will I still be tracking testing or will my machine be running the new stable distribution?
 3.1.13. I am still confused. What did you say I should install?
</code></pre>
<p>3.2. But what about Kali, Knoppix, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and others?</p>
<pre><code> 3.2.1. I know that Kali/Knoppix/Linux Mint/Ubuntu/... is Debian-based. So after installing it on the hard disk, can I use 'apt' package tools on it?
 3.2.2. I installed Kali/Knoppix/Linux Mint/Ubuntu/... on my hard disk. Now I have a problem. What should I do?
 3.2.3. I'm using Kali/Knoppix/Linux Mint/Ubuntu/... and now I want to use Debian. How do I migrate?
